**GraphIT** is a a little drawing program written only with _javascript_.

It has been tested on last version of **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, **IE 9**, **Opera**

This program is really a beta, with beta i'm mean alpha, or, hmm, well who care!

**Notes**
Some features need controle of your own server.
* Loading image: Javascript security deny manipulating image data that come from different domain. One solution to bypass this check is using a proxy who will read image url and return a base 64 encoded image (embedded in JSON object)
To prevent abuse of this proxy, it's better to have some sort of authentication on your proxy server.
